# AI Hardware Project Proposal Template

## 1. Project Title
Ring Camera with AI

Nate Owen 

Identifing specfic humans using facial recognition with Google Coral

## 2. Platform Selection
Google Coral, Edge AI

**Undergraduates:** Edge-AI, TinyML, or Neuromorphic platforms  
**Graduates:** open-source AI accelerators (Ztachip, VTA, Gemmini, VeriGOOD-ML, NVDLA) or any of the above 

## 3. Problem Definition
Describe the AI or hardware design problem you aim to address and its relevance to AI hardware (e.g., efficiency, latency, scalability).

## 4. Technical Objectives
List 3–5 measurable objectives with quantitative targets when possible.
- Use our model to accuratly identify 3 unique faces with an above 80 success rate in normal lighting conditions
- Maintain an average latency of 500ms from image capture to recognition
- Maintain a false postive postive rate of less than 2 percent

## 5. Methodology
Describe your planned approach: hardware setup, software tools, model design, performance metrics, and validation strategy.

## 6. Expected Deliverables
List tangible outputs:
